** Release/PR
*** Before accepting a PR
- Check jenkins
*** Merging the PR
- Squash and commit
*** Making the release (dev -> prod)
- Check jenkins master
- make release
- jenkins
  - old view (arrow at the top)
  - tag
  - release num
  - schedule build
- update version in Deps.scala
Jenkins will update the Airflow DAGS, and the Jar in GCS.
Don't do make airflow-prod as jenkins already does it.
** Test job
run cluster en local :
make create-cluster
make build
make push
./scripts/run_job.sh -s user -j [job]
** Launch shell
*** shell
- make create cluster
- make shell
*** gui
- make ssh tunnel
- make chrome
** Bugs
*** symbol error when make deploy airflow
remove spark function in job code
*** no filestystem for scheme "gs"
create a mock for the fileReader / fileWriter as it may have a GCSServiceWrapper
*** Option 'basePath' must be a directory
The cloud dir location (bucket probably) doesn't point to an existing folder (in /tmp) or on GCS.
Solution :
- set the correct cloud dir location (ie, look in conf, for ex bucket = "ayl-secor", path = "usa02/ssp_actions_json")
- verify that the config is correctly loaded

*** Cannot decode from long to double
Caused by: org.apache.spark.SparkException : java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: org.apache.parquet.column.values.dictionary.PlainValuesDictionary$PlainLongDictionary
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: org.apache.parquet.column.values.dictionary.PlainValuesDictionary$PlainLongDictionary
Fix : - the schema when loading the dataset is not correct
Either don't specify it and let Spark infer it or manually set the schema to the one of the data.
Then cast the col in the wanted type (in our case cast to double)
**** fix ?
Use .as instead .selectAs when taking the DS

override load in adserver then cast priceAdv/pricePub to double
*** org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Partition column day not found in schema

*** Intellij is unauthorized to fetch a dep
NEXUS_USER & NEXUS_PW are set as env variable. However, when Intellij is
launched by xfce, those env variables are lost. It may works if intellij is
launched in a terminal. Other solutions : https://superuser.com/questions/597291/xfce-lightdm-startup-configuration-files
Env variables known by intellij can be seen in run/edit configurations/templates/applications/env variables/browse
*** sbt assembly: deduplicate *.class
Deps issue : verify that a dependency overrides is not needed.
For ex, MLEap comes with Spark 2.4.0 and data-etl-job needs spark 2.4.4 so the fix is :
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
dependencyOverrides ++= Seq(
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-tags" % Deps.sparkVersion,
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-mllib-local" % Deps.sparkVersion)
#+END_SRC
*** Symbol 'type org.apache.spark.ml.param.Params' is missing from the classpath.
The lib necessary is not in the classpath/jar; either it's a dependency conflict or an import is missing.
In this case :
Adds in build.sbt
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  ...
  "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-mllib" % Deps.sparkVersion % Provided,)
#+END_SRC
The provided is important.
*** When running a job : java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: scala.Predef$.refArrayOps([Ljava/lang/Object;)[Ljava/lang/Object
Updates the clusters spec in create-cluster task (makefile)
** Update a dag
- make build publish-dev deploy-dev
- in airflow dag : mark task as success
- wait a moment...
** Access old adserver stat
bucket : ayl-datawarehouse-adserver-stats-cold

** Stat description
*** Visitor
Visitor represents the website a user has visited. It's set with cookies.
For ex, when a user goes to a website A, we put a cookie in the user browser,
and when he goes to a website B, we also put a cookie.
So we have cookies with A and B for this user, so its visitor value will be [A, B].
** kube/docker
*** switch kubectl context to datateam project
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ci --zone europe-west1-d --project datateam-199811
*** list
* Useful ADYL CMD
** read adserver ds in spark shell
val df = spark.read.parquet("gs://ayl-datawarehouse-adserver-stats/day=2020-01-08/hour=00").cache
** count occ when grouping by attempt
Seq("Visitor").foreach{s => println("************\n" + s); val res = df.groupBy("attempt").agg(F.collect_set(F.col(s)).as("visitorCount")).where(F.size($"visitorCount") > 1).cache; res.show(500, false); println(res.count); res.unpersist()}

** Tensorflow Java support
*** Goal
 Loading a tensorflow model in Java and making predictions with that model
 The model is the one that predicts the winning bid for an auction
**** Requirements
*** Supported Platforms
 - Ubuntu 16.04 or higher; 64-bit, x86
 - macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or higher
 - Windows 7 or higher; 64-bit, x86

*** Process
**** Docker image CPU
 To build the binary image

**** Load model
**** Test model
**** TODO Load TF library
**** TODO close TF graph
 https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/?api=org.tensorflow.SavedModelBundle
*** Alternatives
**** Use MLeap
 - MLeap is compatible with Tensorflow.
 - However, the TF runtime is still needed (see https://mleap-docs.combust.ml/getting-started/)

** Auto doc
*** Goal
Creates an auto doc framework
*** Scope
For the moment, fields in table should be document (for ex BillingStat records)
*** Process
- Annotates fields in case class (@Doc("..."))
- Parse all annotated fields, for each :
  - Gets the case class of the field (ie, the table)
- For each case class (table) :
  - creates an HTML table
  - for each field in that table:
    - creates a row in the table with :
      - name
      - description
