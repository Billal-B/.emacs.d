Hello,

I'm interested in your job offer for the following reasons :
- I love the startup mentality, I like when things go fast and I prefer to work in small teams
- I love Clojure and want to use it every day
That's why I'm applying :D
As for me; I'm a data engineer working for a startup in AdTech. I really like the company, but since the confinement our missions got a bit less interesting. I mainly use Scala and Python at work; but I use Clojure for my side projects.

Thanks for reading my cover letter,
Good day to you !
